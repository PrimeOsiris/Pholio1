I have created similar programs in other programming langauges to both of these tasks, however, in my experience they were easier and didn't require multiple files for for it to work.
Also, when I first learned how to create this kind of program, it was using a programming interface that allowed us to both see the code and import default elements like input boxes, meaning that it was much easier.

Much like above, this was just adapting my knowledge to a new programming language and new formats that are needed for the code to run.
